        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>Egg Whites 360g</ul>
        <ul>Water 2tbsp</ul>
        <ul>Superfine Sugar 1-1/4 Cups</ul>
        <ul>Salt 1/2 Tbsp</ul>
        <ul>Cream of Tartar 1-1/2 Tsp</ul>
        <ul>Cake Flour 1 Cup, Sifted</ul>
        <ul>Pink Peppercorns, fresh ground 1 Tbsp</ul>
        <ul>Black Peppercorns, fresh ground 1 Tbsp</ul>
        <h3>Method:</h3>
        <ol>Preheat the oven to 350ᵒ F. Clean the bowl and whip of an electric mixer or a large glass bowl and the beaters of a hand mixer with white vinegar and wipe dry. </ol>
        <ol>Place the egg whites and water in the prepared bowl and whip on low speed until foamy, 1 to 2 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk the sugar, salt, and cream of tartar to combine.</ol>
        <ol>Raise the speed to medium, and begin to add the sugar mixture gradually, whipping to medium peaks. With such a large amount of egg whites this may take longer than you think, 8 to 10 minutes. Do not over whip --- the egg whites should look soft and smooth, not clumpy or dry.</ol>
        <ol>Add about a third of the flour, and fold to combine. This fold can be slightly more vigorous, as you’re “tempering” the batter.</ol>
        <ol>Add the remaining flour in 2 to 3 additions, folding very gently to incorporate. Make sure there are no “pockets” of flour.</ol>
        <ol>Pour the batter into an ungreased springform cake pan lined only around the sides with parchment paper and smooth gently with a small offset spatula (the batter will not even out on its own in the oven like many cake batters do).</ol>
        <ol>Bake until the top is golden brown and the structure is set (it will spring back lightly when touched), 35 to 40 minutes.</ol>
